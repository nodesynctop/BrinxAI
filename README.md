### Note 1: 
If you change the IP for Worker node or add a new worker node, please do not delete any old worker node on Dashboard if it has points displayed. Deleting it will lose all the points generated by that Worker node. Be careful

### Note 2: 
Currently, only one device per IP address is allowed for running nodes.
